# Real-Time Speech Translation

## Overview
This project focuses on real-time translation of spoken language using advanced speech recognition and language processing models. The application utilizes the Whisper model for transcribing speech in real-time, providing immediate translation and transcription.


## Project Details
### Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. Provide real-time transcription of spoken language.
2. Translate transcribed speech into the desired language.
3. Ensure high accuracy and low latency in the translation process.

### Methodology
#### Speech Recognition
- **Whisper Model**: Utilized the Whisper model to transcribe spoken language in real-time. The model can handle various levels of noise and different accents.

#### Translation
- **Real-Time Translation**: Integrated translation capabilities to provide immediate translations of the transcribed speech.

#### Data Handling
- **Queue Management**: Used a queue system to handle real-time audio data efficiently.
- **Energy Threshold Adjustment**: Configured energy thresholds to optimize the speech recognition process.

### Features
1. **Real-Time Transcription**: Transcribes speech in real-time with high accuracy.
2. **Immediate Translation**: Provides instant translation of the transcribed text.
3. **Noise Handling**: Effective in environments with background noise.
4. **Customizable Models**: Support for various model sizes and languages.

## Example Usage

### Scenario: Live Translation during a Meeting
**Description:** This project can be used to provide real-time translation of speech during a meeting. Participants can speak in their native language, and the system will transcribe and translate their speech in real-time.

**Steps:**
1. **Setup**: Install the necessary dependencies and configure the microphone settings.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model size and language settings.
3. **Start Transcription**: Run the transcription script to start capturing and translating speech in real-time.
4. **View Transcription**: The transcribed and translated text will be displayed on the screen for participants to view.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Communication**: Breaks language barriers during live meetings and events.
- **Efficiency**: Provides quick and accurate translations, improving communication flow.
- **Versatility**: Can be adapted for various languages and environments.
